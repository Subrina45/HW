let age = 90; // e.g.

/**
 * Increment the variable "age" by 1. (That is, add 1).
 * Use the increment operator to solve this problem.
 * This should still work when "age" is a different number.

// WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE
let x = 90;
const y = x++;

console.log(`x:${x}, y:${y}`);
// expected output: "x:4, y:3"

//or

age++;
